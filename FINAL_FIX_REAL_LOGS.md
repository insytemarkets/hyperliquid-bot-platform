# 🔥 FINAL FIX - Real-Time Trading Bot Logs

## What I Fixed:

### **Problem:**
- Bot was getting price data but couldn't match coin names
- "BTC" in your strategy didn't match whatever Hyperliquid returns
- Strategy analysis was NEVER running (stopped at "No valid price data")

### **Solution:**
1. **Coin Name Normalization** - Handles all formats:
   - `BTC-USD` → `BTC`
   - `BTCUSDT` → `BTC`
   - `BTC-PERP` → `BTC`
   
2. **Flexible API Response Parsing** - Works with both:
   - Object format: `{ "BTC": 43250.5 }`
   - Array format: `[["BTC", "43250.5"]]`

3. **Better Error Logging** - Shows available coins when match fails
